# Documentation Guidelines

## Minimize Documentation Files

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT create excessive documentation files. Aim for **MAXIMUM 1 documentation file per task**.

### Rules:
1. **Default behavior**: Complete tasks WITHOUT creating any documentation files unless explicitly requested
2. **If documentation is needed**: Create AT MOST 1 comprehensive document instead of multiple files
3. **Avoid documentation proliferation**: Do NOT create multiple summary files, analysis files, guide files, or report files for a single task
4. **Focus on code**: Prioritize writing functional code over writing documentation about the code

### Anti-patterns to AVOID:
- Creating multiple `.md` files like `SUMMARY.md`, `ANALYSIS.md`, `GUIDE.md`, `REPORT.md`, etc. for one task
- Writing documentation as the primary output when code changes were requested
- Getting "stuck" in documentation mode, creating file after file
- Creating separate files for summaries, findings, next steps, etc.

### When to create documentation:
- User explicitly requests documentation
- Creating a README for a new standalone project/module
- Complex architectural decisions that need to be recorded (consolidate into ONE file)

### Example:
❌ BAD: User asks to implement feature X → You create: `IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `SUMMARY.md`, `NEXT_STEPS.md`, `FINDINGS.md`
✅ GOOD: User asks to implement feature X → You implement the feature in code (maybe create 1 doc if truly needed)
